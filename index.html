                    <p class="testimony">I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to
                        make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                        the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                        weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
                        successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>

                        present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the

                    <p class="testimony">Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
                        structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
                        enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
                        entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait
                        long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning
                        to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
                        during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job
                        as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! </p>
